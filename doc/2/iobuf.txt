== DESCRIPTION

This module provide simpler and faster alternative to bufio(2).
On reading text file it's about 30-40 times faster than bufio,
on writing text file it's about 3-4 times faster than bufio.

*init* must be called before invoking any other operation of the module.

=== ReadBuf

ReadBuf is used when we receive stream of bytes (from fd or
file2chan for ex.) while we need to read by full records (either
separated by some delimiter or having known size).

Reading from ReadBuf is blocking operation.

*setsep* convert 'sep' from string to array of byte, and *reads* will use
that array to search for separator.
If separator will be Unicode char which may be encoded with different
sequences of bytes, *reads* may fail to find it.

*reads* return record separated by 'sep', optionally with separator
stripped from end of record.
Last record may not end with separator, so ReadBuf can't distinguish
between incomplete record because of unexpected EOF and full last record
without separator.
Will return nil on EOF.
Will raise on I/O error.
Will raise if neither 'sep' nor EOF will be found in 'bufsize' bytes.

*readn* return record with 'n' bytes size, or less on EOF.
It's possible to have 'n' greater than 'bufsize'.
Will return array with less than 'n' bytes on EOF.
Will return nil on EOF.
Will raise on I/O error.

Arrays returned by *reads* and *readn* usually will be slices of
ReadBuf's internal buffer, which may be overwritten on next
*reads* or *readn* calls, so these calls may change contents of
previously returned arrays.

When ReadBuf used with chan instead of fd, 'queuesize' define
maximum amount of packets (not bytes!) received from chan, which
wasn't fetched yet by *reads* or *readn*.
This is needed to optimize latency.

When ReadBuf used with chan, while one process may block in
*reads* or *readn*, another may receive data from chan, and
should call *fill* to put this data into ReadBuf.

*fill* will either immediately send reply to 'wc' if it was able
to add data to ReadBuf, or save pending 'data' and 'wc' in
ReadBuf (reply to 'wc' will be sent later from process
calling *reads* or *readn*).
Call to *fill* never blocks.
Will send error "concurrent writes not supported" to 'wc'
and drop 'data' if will be called again before reply to
previous 'wc' will be sent (i.e. when previous 'wc' is in
pending state because of full incoming queue).

Resume:

* Process reading from ReadBuf doesn't need to know about
  data source (fd or chan).
* Process reading from ReadBuf may intermix reads() and
  readn(), may change record separator at any time.
* Process reading from ReadBuf receive nil on EOF or got
  exception on I/O error.
* Process receiving data from chan (usually, file2chan) for
  ReadBuf just call fill() and don't bother about errors or
  replying to 'wc'.

Limitations:

* Unicode separator may not be detected in some cases.
* Offset/seek doesn't supported (so offset received with
  file2chan request will be ignored).
* No getb(), getc(), ungetb(), ungetc() - but they can be
  added later.
* Only one process may call reads() or readn() and only one
  (another) process may call fill().

=== WriteBuf

WriteBuf is used when we sending stream of bytes (to fd or
file2chan for ex.) while we want to write data by (possibly
small) records.

Writing to WriteBuf is blocking operation.

*write* is adding data from 'buf' to WriteBuf. Size of 'buf' may
be greater than 'bufsize'.
It may call *flush*.
Will raise on I/O error.

*flush* ensure all buffered data in WriteBuf is actually written.
Will raise on I/O error.

When WriteBuf used with chan, while one process may block in
*write* or *flush*, another may receive read request from chan,
and should call *request* to let *write* or *flush* send data from
WriteBuf to chan when they'll be ready.

*eof* calls *flush*, but what it does next depends on WriteBuf type.
When WriteBuf used with fd, it do nothing more and just returns.
When WriteBuf used with chan, it'll wait for next *request* and will reply
on all with EOF *(nil,nil)*, and will returns only after got *request*
with *nil* 'rc'.

*request* notified WriteBuf about data requested by chan, to let
*write* or *flush* to send data from 'buf' to chan.
Call to *request* never blocks.
Will send error "concurrent reads not supported" to 'rc'
if will be called again before reply to previous 'rc' will
be sent.

Resume:

* Process writing to WriteBuf doesn't need to know about
  data destination (fd or chan).
* Process writing to WriteBuf got exception on I/O error.
* Process receiving read requests from chan (usually, file2chan)
  from WriteBuf just call request() and don't bother about errors
  or replying to 'rc'.

Limitations:

* Offset/seek doesn't supported (so offset received with
  file2chan request will be ignored).
* Only one process may call write() or flush() and only one
  (another) process may call request().
